Description: A Haskell extension for PostgreSQL that allows embedded Haskell code.
 This project is a "procedural language" extension of PostgreSQL allowing the
 execution of code in Haskell within SQL code. Despite the name, Haskell is, of
 course, not a procedural language as it is a functional language. However,
 "procedural language" is the term that PostgreSQL uses to describe languages
 that can be embedded in its SQL code.
 .
 The extension allows users, even unprivileged ones, to write, install, and run
 functions written in Haskell.
